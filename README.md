# Random-User-API-Performance-Test

## About this Project
##  Performance testing ensure that the software is fast, stable and can handle multiple user. In this project, I tested the API performance on  random users by JMeter. To find out how a system behaves under expected load and tested how a system behaves when the load is gradually increased.

## Tools & Technology used:
- JMeter
- HTTPS site

## Prerequisites
- install jdk 8 or 11
- for jdk setup go to your c drive > program files > java > jdk > bin > copy the bin file path
- setup JAVA_HOME
- install JMeter
- setup JMETER_HOME

## How to run this project :
- clone this project
- give following command:
-  ``` npm i ```
